# Terraform AWS (Extensions) Provider

This is a Terraform provider to extend the functionality of the [AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs).

At time of creation, Hashicorp had few review resources dedicated to the provider.
As a result, there are over 400 open pull requests, many older than 4 years.

The purpose of this provider is to rapidly augment the official provider.
This can also be used to rapidly experiment with new resources.
